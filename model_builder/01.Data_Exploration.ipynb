Here they're getting a list of files in a directory, then filtering the list for all files that match a regular expression criteria.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>    files = os.listdir(path)                               \n    test = re.compile(\"test\\.py$\", re.IGNORECASE)          \n    files = [f for f in files if test.search(f)]\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You could do this without regular expressions, for your example, for anything where your expression at the end returns true for a match.  There are other options like using the filter() function, but if I were going to choose, I'd go with this.</p>\n\n<p>Eric Sipple</p>\n","_deepnote_index_column":7},{"Id":735,"OwnerUserId":"145.0","CreationDate":"2008-08-03T15:47:22Z","ParentId":683,"Score":-2,"Body":"<p>I think:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>#!/bin/python<br>bar in dict(Foo)<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Is what you are thinking of.  When trying to see if a certain key exists within a dictionary in python (python's version of a hash table) there are two ways to check.  First is the <strong><code>has_key()</code></strong> method attached to the dictionary and second is the example given above.  It will return a boolean value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That should answer your question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now a little off topic to tie this in to the <em>list comprehension</em> answer previously given (for a bit more clarity).  <em>List Comprehensions</em> construct a list from a basic <em>for loop</em> with modifiers.  As an example (to clarify slightly), a way to use the <code>in dict</code> language construct in a _list comprehension_:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say you have a two dimensional dictionary <strong><code>foo</code></strong> and you only want the second dimension dictionaries which contain the key <strong><code>bar</code></strong>.  A relatively straightforward way to do so would be to use a <em>list comprehension</em> with a conditional as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>#!/bin/python<br>baz = dict([(key, value) for key, value in foo if bar in value])<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Note the <strong><code>if bar in value</code></strong> at the end of the statement<strong>, this is a modifying clause which tells the <em>list comprehension</em> to only keep those key-value pairs which meet the conditional.</strong>  In this case <strong><code>baz</code></strong> is a new dictionary which contains only the dictionaries from foo which contain bar (Hopefully I didn't miss anything in that code example... you may have to take a look at the list comprehension documentation found in <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007140000000000000000\" rel=\"nofollow\">docs.python.org tutorials</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk\" rel=\"nofollow\">secnetix.de</a>, both sites are good references if you have questions in the future.).</p>","_deepnote_index_column":8},{"Id":745,"OwnerUserId":"154.0","CreationDate":"2008-08-03T15:59:19Z","ParentId":683,"Score":8,"Body":"<p>Are you looking to get a list of objects that have a certain attribute?

Nevertheless, it seems that it makes use of the first strategy. <a href=\"https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/v0.18.1/scipy/fftpack/basic.py\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>scipy.fftpack.fftn()</code></a> calls <a href=\"https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/fftpack/src/zfftnd.c\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>scipy.fftpack.zfftnd()</code></a> which calls <a href=\"https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/fftpack/src/zfft.c\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>zfft()</code></a>, based on <a href=\"https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/fftpack/src/dfftpack/zfftf1.f\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>zfftf1</code></a> which does not seem to handle strided DFTs. Moreover, <code>zfftnd()</code> calls many times the function <a href=\"https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/fftpack/src/zfftnd.c\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>flatten()</code></a> which performs the transposition.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another example: for parallel distributed memory multidimensionnal DFTs, <a href=\"http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Transposed-distributions.html#Transposed-distributions\" rel=\"nofollow\">FFTW-MPI uses the first strategy</a> to avoid any MPI communications between processes during 1D DTFs. Of course, <a href=\"http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/FFTW-MPI-Transposes.html#FFTW-MPI-Transposes\" rel=\"nofollow\">functions to transpose the array</a> are not far away and a lot a MPI communications are involved in the process.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are there any other numpy array routines that could affect stride structure? What can be done in those cases?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/search?p=1&amp;q=swapaxes&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93\" rel=\"nofollow\">search the github repository of numpy for <code>swapaxes</code></a>: this funtion is only used a couple of times. Hence, to my mind, this \"change of strides\" is particular to <code>fft.fftn()</code> and most numpy functions keep the strides unchanged.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the \"change of strides\" is a feature of the first strategy and there is no way to prevent that. The only workaround is to swap the axes at the end of the computation, which is costly. But you can rely on <code>pyfftw</code> since <code>fftw</code> implements the second strategy in a very efficient way. The DFT computations will be faster, and subsequent computations will be faster as well if the strides of the different arrays become consistent.</p>\n","_deepnote_index_column":987070},{"Id":40142209,"OwnerUserId":1832058,"CreationDate":"2016-10-19T21:59:32Z","ParentId":40139628,"Score":0,"Body":"<p>Problem is because you use always <code>if left == 0: namel = \"Rash\" even if</code>\"Rash\"<code>was deleted from listbox and now</code>left == 0<code>means</code>\"Untss\".</p>\n\n<p>You have to get selected name instead of index </p>\n\n<pre><code>    namel = lbox.get(lbox.curselection()[0])\n    namer = rbox.get(rbox.curselection()[0])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and use it </p>\n\n<pre><code>    if namel == \"Rush\":\n       totalleft = Rash.total\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But you could use dictionary to get data </p>\n\n<pre><code>left_characters = {        \n    \"Rash\": Character(\"Rash\", 42, 50, 80),\n    \"Untss\": Character(\"Untss\", 15, 54, 100),\n    \"Ilora\": Character(\"Ilora\", 60, 35, 80),\n}\n\nright_characters = {\n    \"Zys\": Character(\"Zys\", 12, 97, 83),\n    \"Eentha\": Character(\"Eentha\", 55, 17, 90),\n    \"Dant\": Character(\"Dant\", 73, 28, 88),\n}\n\nleftnames = list(left_characters.keys())\nrightnames = list(right_characters.keys())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then</p>\n\n<pre><code>def fight():\n\n    try:\n        namel = lbox.get(lbox.curselection()[0])\n        namer = rbox.get(rbox.curselection()[0])\n\n        print(namel)\n        print(namer)\n\n        totalleft = left_characters[namel].total\n        totalright = right_characters[namer].total\n\n        lbox.delete(lbox.curselection()[0])\n        rbox.delete(rbox.curselection()[0])\n\n        if totalleft &gt; totalright : #Checks if won or lost\n            wins.set(wins.get()+\"\\n\"+namel)\n            loss.set(loss.get()+\"\\n\"+namer)\n        else:\n            wins.set(wins.get()+\"\\n\"+namer)\n            loss.set(loss.get()+\"\\n\"+namel)\n    except IndexError as e:\n        print(\"ERROR:\", e)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you add new characters to dictionary then you don't have to change code.</p>\n\n<p>BTW: don't use <code>pass</code> in <code>except</code> because you don't see error if there is something wrong with code.</p>\n","_deepnote_index_column":987071},{"Id":40142235,"OwnerUserId":4632703,"CreationDate":"2016-10-19T22:01:05Z","ParentId":39375227,"Score":0,"Body":"<p>This is a crude way of doing it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>lat_1 = 58\nlat_2 = 60\nlon_1 = 2\nlon_2 = 5\nsize = 0 \nage2 = 0 \n\nfor parts in range(10):\n    for length in range(len(lon)):\n        if lon[length,parts] &lt; lon_2:\n            if lon[length,parts] &gt; lon_1:\n                if lat[length,parts] &gt; lat_1:\n                    if lat[length,parts] &lt; lat_2:\n                        age = (age[length, parts])\n                        size = size + 1\n                        age2 = age + age2\n                        mean = age2/size\n</code></pre>\n","_deepnote_index_column":987072},{"Id":40142263,"OwnerUserId":3125566,"CreationDate":"2016-10-19T22:02:47Z","ParentId":40142166,"Score":1,"Body":"<p>Use the arrays' <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.size.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>size</code></a> attribute instead:</p>\n\n<pre><code>nv = v.size\nnu = u.size\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You also probably want to use <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.fromstring.html#numpy.fromstring\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>numpy.fromstring</code></a> to take and convert the input string into an array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; v = np.fromstring(input('enter the elements of the vector separated by comma: '), dtype=int, sep=',')\nenter the elements of the vector separated by comma: 1, 2, 3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; v\narray([1, 2, 3])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; len(v)\n3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; v.size\n3\n</code></pre>\n","_deepnote_index_column":987073},{"Id":40142305,"OwnerUserId":5393381,"CreationDate":"2016-10-19T22:06:11Z","ParentId":40142166,"Score":-2,"Body":"<p>The problem is that a <code>numpy</code>-<strong>scalar</strong> has no length.

One from the left side and one from the right side. After they fight both should be deleted regardless of who wins or loses. They are in fact deleted from listboxes, but after you have two more charachters from each side fight those previous characters sometimes show up. If you start with Zys and Rash fighting no other names are printed in the win and loss section besides theirs. Only when you go backwards from Dant and Ilora does it work the way it should with each character making a place in either wins or loss only once. If you start with some other characters they could be put in the wins and loss section more then once. It is also possible for a character to be placed as a win or loss even if it hasnt been selected to fight. The bottomline is each character gets to fight  a character on the opposite side ONCE and after that it is placed and then deleted with no use in the later part of the program.
