When trying to see if a certain key exists within a dictionary in python (python's version of a hash table) there are two ways to check.  First is the <strong><code>has_key()</code></strong> method attached to the dictionary and second is the example given above.  It will return a boolean value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That should answer your question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now a little off topic to tie this in to the <em>list comprehension</em> answer previously given (for a bit more clarity).  <em>List Comprehensions</em> construct a list from a basic <em>for loop</em> with modifiers.  As an example (to clarify slightly), a way to use the <code>in dict</code> language construct in a _list comprehension_:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say you have a two dimensional dictionary <strong><code>foo</code></strong> and you only want the second dimension dictionaries which contain the key <strong><code>bar</code></strong>.  A relatively straightforward way to do so would be to use a <em>list comprehension</em> with a conditional as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>#!/bin/python<br>baz = dict([(key, value) for key, value in foo if bar in value])<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Note the <strong><code>if bar in value</code></strong> at the end of the statement<strong>, this is a modifying clause which tells the <em>list comprehension</em> to only keep those key-value pairs which meet the conditional.</strong>  In this case <strong><code>baz</code></strong> is a new dictionary which contains only the dictionaries from foo which contain bar (Hopefully I didn't miss anything in that code example... you may have to take a look at the list comprehension documentation found in <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007140000000000000000\" rel=\"nofollow\">docs.python.org tutorials</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk\" rel=\"nofollow\">secnetix.de</a>, both sites are good references if you have questions in the future.).</p>",

If you start with Zys and Rash fighting no other names are printed in the win and loss section besides theirs. Only when you go backwards from Dant and Ilora does it work the way it should with each character making a place in either wins or loss only once. If you start with some other characters they could be put in the wins and loss section more then once. It is also possible for a character to be placed as a win or loss even if it hasnt been selected to fight. The bottomline is each character gets to fight  a character on the opposite side ONCE and after that it is placed and then deleted with no use in the later part of the program.

You can add missiles to the group by saying <code>missiles_group.add(&lt;sprite instance name&gt;)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>As for the sprite class, please see this answer I gave to a question. To be terse, a Sprite class is a modular way to create a sprite. Instead of using just  a plain image, a sprite class would hold necessary methods and attributes of a sprite. I will be using a sprite class in my example below, so if more detail is needed, please read the answer I linked to above. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>With that out of the way, and without going into too much detail, here is how you fill in each function parameter to the above function.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>sprite</code>: This is the sprite that will be tested against a group of sprites</li>\n<li><code>group</code>: This is the group that will be used to test with the sprite.</li>\n<li><code>dokill</code>: This is a boolean value. If set to true, each time the <code>sprite</code> parameter collides with something in the <code>group</code> parameter, and object from the group parameter will be deleted. And visa versa if the <code>dokill</code> argument is set to false.\nThe is one more parameter that the function takes, but for what you're trying to do, it is not needed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Incorporating the above information, here is an example.
